User notes on BCTpy toolbox

The suffixes on the methods are trying to tell you what type of input it takes.
Example: clustering_coef_bu
    - "bu" stands for binarized, unweighted.

Found that if you add zeroes to the diagonal, replacing nan's, then the clustereing algorithms work.
- This action should not change the math, based on the fact that the algorithm masks by "not 0"
