Checking the logic of connected graphs (i.e., "whole brain") in gaf 

1) Start at save_long_format_results
2) Get all network parcels.
    - Because "whole_brain" is passed, no filtering should occur.
    - Checked with len of network_parcels
3) Individual graphs are sent to separate threads by way of collate_graph_measures
4) collate_graph_measures's subgraph_network is by default None, which is what is passed from save_long_format_results explicitly for whole_brain
5) For WB, the next step is parallel_graph_msr, which is really a wrapper for individ_graph_msrs.
    a) create_density_based_network at the prop_thr. This is whole brain MST + whatever number of edges are needed to get to threshold value. Individuals may vary in which edges are included, but not in the number of edges.
    b) Whole brain does not go through the subgraph building method, filter_density_based_network, which simply applies a mask to get ROIs' values for a specific network. This method alters the nx.graph data structure to only include ROIs in the network of interest as a subgraph.
    c) calculate_graph_msrs with the thresholded network (i.e., modified nx.graph data structure)
    d) Add identifier columns
    e) Make sure the network column is filled with "whole_brain"
    f) Add the subject identifer that is readable via utils.subject_converter. (Validated)
